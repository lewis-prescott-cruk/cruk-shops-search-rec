# Cancer Research UK Shops - Search

## Overview
Your task is to create automated checks for the search function for the CRUK find a shop search ([https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/get-involved/find-a-shop](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/get-involved/find-a-shop)).

## Scenarios
You need to test the following scenarios (this is a live website, please don't overuse the page/functionality):

1. create a "happy path" scenario.
2. create a negative scenario.

## Guidance
We strongly recommend you use a test framework. (We use Cypress.io at CRUK) to solve the challenge. Use good practices for the test architecture and setup.

## Documentation
Please describe in a README.md file how to run the tests and any other additional info needed about any assumptions you make.

## On Completion
Please either: 
1. Zip up the project and send it back to the hiring manager
2. Publish to your github and send us the link
